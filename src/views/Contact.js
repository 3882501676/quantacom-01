  This form is setup to use Netlify's form handling:

  - the form action is set to the current absolute url: \`action: '/contact/'\`
  - a name attribute is sent with the form's data \`'form-name': 'Contact'\`
  - netlify data attributes are added to the form \`data-netlify data-netlify-honeypot\`
